         <q>I fondly remember Mom going out of her way to celebrate us on our birthdays. I remember going to Boy Scout summer camp when I was about to turn 12. I was going to be away from home on my birthday, so without telling me, Mom asked one of my buddies to make sure that my troop celebrated me on my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised when the whole troop sang Happy Birthday to me. It was so typical of Mom to go out of her way to make sure that each of us was celebrated on our birthdays. She would always ask us what we wanted for breakfast and for dinner. She go out of her way to make the day as special as possible. The morning of my 9th birthday, she woke up early to take me to the beach to see the sun rise, just because that was something I always wanted to do.</q>

         <q>My fondest memory of mom is when she would work so hard to make Christmas time, the best time. I loved helping her in the kitchen with the countless cookies and treats she would make for us. She made Christmas such a magical time.</q>
