         <q>I remember how dry her feet would get and she would always coerce one of us kids into massaging lotion into her feet. Whenever we asked what we would get in return she always said 'my undying love and affection'.</q>

         <q>I fondly remember Mom going out of her way to celebrate us on our birthdays. I remember going to Boy Scout summer camp when I was about to turn 12. I was going to be away from home on my birthday, so without telling me, Mom asked one of my buddies to make sure that my troop celebrated me on my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised when the whole troop sang Happy Birthday to me. It was so typical of Mom to go out of her way to make sure that each of us was celebrated on our birthdays. She would always ask us what we wanted for breakfast and for dinner. She go out of her way to make the day as special as possible. The morning of my 9th birthday, she woke up early to take me to the beach to see the sun rise, just because that was something I always wanted to do.</q>

         <q>My fondest memory of mom is when she would work so hard to make Christmas time, the best time. I loved helping her in the kitchen with the countless cookies and treats she would make for us. She made Christmas such a magical time.</q>

         <q>Birthdays. Mom always made sure they were special no matter if it was a big party celebration or a family celebration. Special breakfast, no chores that day, special dinner followed by dessert (honoring haha) and gifts. Sweet good memories.</q>

         <q>Mom always had an listening ear it's listening ear whether it's for her kids, comma her family, or even friends shw hadn't seen in years would call her for her insight. She was patient but firm/strict. I loved how her getting a drive through Diet coke/coke zero was her treat that she enjoyed doing for herself.</q>

            Little Bunny Foo Foo
            Hopping through the forest,
            Scooping up the field mice
            And bopping them on the head.
            And down, down, down came the Good Fairy, and said:
            ‚ÄúLittle Bunny Foo Foo
            I don‚Äôt want to see you
            Scooping up the field mice
            And bopping them on the head.
            I‚Äôm going to give you three chances,
            And if you don‚Äôt behave,
            And then, I‚Äôm going to turn you into a‚Ä¶GOOOOOON!‚Äù</q>

           Mom and I, in the airport, late at night, waiting for a red eye to Hawaii.  I think it was 2012? ‚Ä¶and she says to me:  knock knock, I say who‚Äôs there, and she says Supersonic Cow‚Ä¶and I say, super sonic cow who?   And she turns her head from left to right real fast‚Ä¶with no sound and then a couple of seconds later she says ‚ÄúMoooooo
           <br><br>I loved how fiercely she loved you all, God and me.
           <br><br>She loved to cook and school you!
